# DirectX-Swarm-AI
Block 2 task for my Advanced Technologies module assignments.

The goal of this assignment was to create an optimised system that can simulate at least 10,000 agents (with collisions) simultaneously.

Optimisation techniques used to achieve this include instancing and spatial partitioning (static grid).

## Controls

WASD - Move the camera, your swarm follows the camera's centre position

Mouse Wheel - Zoom in/out

Escape - Quit application
